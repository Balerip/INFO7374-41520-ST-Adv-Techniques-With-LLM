    "Machine Learning is a field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed. In other words, we can say that ML is a field of AI consisting of learning algorithms that improves their performance (P) at executing some task (T) over time with experience (E). Experience*Task=Performance. Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence focused on building systems that can learn from historical data, identify patterns, and make logical decisions with little to no human intervention.\n",

Users can take charge of their multimedia streaming and customize their interactions owing to the system's ability to compile and recommend content based on their preferences It can adapt and learn from each user's interactions, leading to a more personalized and engaging experience. Machine learning helps users discover content that aligns with their specific interests, making it easier to navigate this extensive catalog as Netflix has a vast and constantly growing library of movies and TV shows. Netflix wants users to discover new and diverse content. Machine learning algorithms can recommend not only popular content but also hidden gems that align with a user's unique preferences."

    "Data cleaning refers to identifying and correcting errors in the dataset that may negatively impact a predictive model. Data cleaning is used to refer to all kinds of tasks and activities to detect and repair errors in the data\n",
    "Data cleaning is the process of fixing or removing incorrect, corrupted, incorrectly formatted, duplicate, or incomplete data within a dataset. When combining multiple data sources, there are many opportunities for data to be duplicated or mislabeled. If data is incorrect, outcomes and algorithms are unreliable, even though they may look correct. There is no one absolute way to prescribe the exact steps in the data cleaning process because the processes will vary from dataset to dataset. But it is crucial to establish a template for your data cleaning process so you know you are doing it the right way every time.\n",
    "There are many reasons data may have incorrect values, such as being mistyped, corrupted, duplicated, and so on. \n",
    "\n",
    "Having clean data will ultimately increase overall productivity and allow for the highest quality information in your decision-making. Benefits include:\n",
    "\n",
    "Removal of errors when multiple sources of data are at play.\n",
    "Fewer errors make for happier clients and less-frustrated employees.\n",
    "\n",
    "Duplicates usually show up when data is blended from different sources (e.g., spreadsheets, websites, and databases) or when a customer has multiple points of contact with a company or has submitted redundant forms. This repeated data uses up server space and processing resources, creating larger files and less efficient analysis.\n",
    "in this case data cleaning can help with removing the duplicates and only keeping the unique values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Manage Incomplete Data: Data might be missing values for a few reasons (e.g., customers not providing certain information), and addressing it is vital to analysis as it prevents bias and miscalculations. After isolating and examining the incomplete values, which can show up as “0,” “NA,” “none,” “null,” or “not applicable,” determine if those are plausible values or due to missing information. While the easiest solution might be to drop the incomplete data, be aware of any bias that might result in that action. Alternatives include replacing null values with substitutes based on statistical or conditional modeling or flagging and commenting on the missing data.\n",
